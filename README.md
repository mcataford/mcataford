### Ahoy :wave:

I'm Marc and I'm a software engineering working in Toronto, Canada.

I'm currently leading a team doing some pretty cool stuff at [Tophat](https://tophat.com/company/work-with-us/) using React and Django.

I also dabble in [open source](https://github.com/tophat/), baking and fermented foods.

Current interests: Typescript, service-oriented architecture, finding out how to make my own kimchi.
