# Hey :wave:

🧔 My name is Marc and I'm a computer engineer working remotely from __Ottawa, Canada__.

🛠️ During the day, I'm an Engineering Manager at [Fellow](https://fellow.app), where I help engineers grow as professionals and build awesome new features while keeping the bar high for code and product quality. If you are interested in running _excellent_ meetings and getting the most out of the conversations you have, you should definitely check it out!

🎯 I'm deeply interested in fostering __engineering excellence__ however I can, making sure that __tough discussions about quality__ are happening and upping __developer and customer experience__.

🧠 I fiddle with __code__ (not here anymore, but over [there](https://forge.karnov.club/marc)), __bake__ and __ferment foods__.

❓ My current interests lie in hands-on technical leadership, managing technical debt, and growing houseplants and engineering talent.

🥞 My favourite stack has some __Python__ and __Javascript/Typescript__ in it, but I've been exploring (and loving) __Go__.
