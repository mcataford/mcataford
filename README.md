# Hey :wave:

🧔 I'm Marc and I'm a software engineer working remotely from Ottawa, Canada.

🛠️ I'm currently leading a team doing some pretty cool stuff in the EdTech space at [Tophat](https://tophat.com/company/work-with-us/) using React, Django and FastAPI.

🧠 I dabble in [open source](https://github.com/tophat/), baking and fermented foods.

❓ Current interests: Backend services, infrastructure, keeping things in tip-top shape and growing houseplants.

💬 Want to chat? Send me an [email](mailto:hello@karnov.club) or poke me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marccataford/).

## Words

I don't quite have a blog, but I do have gists.
